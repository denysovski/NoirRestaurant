# Restaurant Noir
NOIR is a web-based digital presence crafted for a luxury European cuisine restaurant, designed to translate fine dining into a refined, immersive online experience. Built as a front-end–driven website, NOIR emphasizes elegance, atmosphere, and clarity, allowing the restaurant’s identity to shine without distraction.
The platform balances upscale sophistication with modern usability, ensuring guests feel the same sense of confidence and exclusivity online as they do at the table.

## What it does
- Elegant brand presentation: Showcase NOIR’s culinary philosophy, menu highlights, and ambiance without visual noise or complexity.
- Refined visual storytelling: Present dishes, interiors, and concepts through carefully structured layouts and balanced typography.
- Smooth, responsive experience: Lightweight front end optimized for fast loading, seamless navigation, and fluid transitions.
- Luxury visual language: Dark tones, subtle gradients, soft lighting effects, and precise spacing create a premium, European fine-dining aesthetic.

## Build timeline
- Front-End Development: Built as a modern, responsive website with a component-based structure tailored for luxury hospitality.
- Vibe Coding with GitHub Copilot: Copilot was used to accelerate layout logic, interaction flow, and clean component implementation while preserving design intent.
- Aura-Inspired Visual Direction: Aura-style vibe building guided typography, spacing, motion, and color harmony to maintain a cohesive, upscale feel.

## Platform vision
Most restaurant websites are either overly decorative or functionally cold. NOIR sits between those extremes: visually rich yet restrained, luxurious yet approachable. The goal is to reflect the discipline, craftsmanship, and elegance of European cuisine through a calm, confident digital presence.
Whether browsing the menu, exploring the restaurant’s story, or planning a visit, NOIR delivers an experience that feels curated, atmospheric, and unmistakably premium.
